      <h1 class="emphasized" id="topo">Why I love Taos, N.M.</h1>
      <h2>Sign up for the course now.</h2>
      <p class="standout">Taos is a small town in the mountains of northern New Mexico. It's cooler
  than the southern part of the state, because it's 7,000 feet high. Many of the
  residents are high, too. (But not me. I'm weird without any help.)</p>

      <p class="important">Warning: <span class="emphasized standout">We have no slow lorises here.</span></p>

      <h2 class="typewritter">This heading is in typewriter text.</h2>

      <p class="typewriter">This paragraph is also in typewriter text.</p>

      <p class="more-readable">Slow lorises are a group of several species of strepsirrhine primates which make up the genus
        Nycticebus. They have a round head, narrow snout, large eyes, and a variety of distinctive coloration
        patterns that are species-dependent.</p>

        <p class="spacey">It's great to be able to control spacing between letters, words and lines, but, unless you're a professional designer, it's a good idea not to try to be too creative with these options.</p>

        <h1>Hydrogen Skateboards</h1>

        <p class="pretty">Slow lorises are a group of several species of strepsirrhine primates which make up the genus
          Nycticebus. They have a round head, narrow snout, large eyes, and a variety of distinctive coloration
          patterns that are species-dependent. Found in Southeast Asia and bordering areas, they range from Bangladesh and Northeast India in the west to the Phillipines in the east, and from Yunnan province in
          China in the north to the island of Java in the south.</p>

        <h3>Centered headings can look very nice.</h3>

        <p class="pretty">Justified text has always been used by professional designers. Before word processing came along, justification made text look professionally "typeset" since a typewriter couldn't do it. But now that almost any word processor can even out the right edge, justification doesn't have the prestige it used to enjoy. And, if a block of text is narrow, with few words per line, things can get pretty ugly, thanks to all those big gaps between words. These days, it's harder to justify justification.</p>

        <blockquote>
          <p>Slow lorises are a group of several species of strepsirrhine primates which make up the genus
            Nycticebus. They have a round head, narrow snout, large eyes, and a variety of distinctive coloration
            patterns that are species-dependent.</p>

        <p class="tabbed">Whether you indent the first line of a paragraph or not, and how much you indent, is a matter of taste. Some designers prefer to separate paragraphs with whitespace, specifying bottom margins. Other designers like to indent the first line. Usually, when one method is used, the other method is not used.</p>

        <blockquote><p>By default, a blockquote is set in. Optionally, you can also style it, as I do here by specifying grey in the CSS. Frequently, designers also change the size of blockquote text, making it either smaller or larger than normal text. And, of course, you can change the font-family if you want to. But avoid fancy fonts, please.</p></blockquote>

       <p class="offset">Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.</p>

       <h2 class="enclosed">Where can I get some?</h2>

       <h4>Centered headings are classy.</h4>
        <p class="mid">In general, it's best to center short text, like headings and paragraphs that contain just a few words. When you center longer passages, even a couple of sentences like this, you make the text hard to read and give an impression of flakiness.</p>

        <h2 id="warm">Used judiciously, colored headings can make a page look friendlier.</h2>

        <div>
          um texto dentro da div.
        </div>

        <span>um texto dentro de um span.</span>

        <div id="midpage">
          <h2>This is a heading inside the div.</h2>
          <p>This is a paragraph inside the div. The heading inherits the font-family of the div because no font-family has been assigned to h2 headings in the CSS file. Paragraphs, on the other hand, have been styled with Georgia and its relatives. The specific styling for paragraphs overrides the styling of the div. If you want paragraphs inside the div to display in Arial and its relatives like the heading, you'd have to style these paragraphs specifically, with a class of their own.</p>
