      <h1 class="emphasized">Why I love Taos, N.M.</h1>

      <p class="standout">Taos is a small town in the mountains of northern New Mexico. It's cooler
  than the southern part of the state, because it's 7,000 feet high. Many of the
  residents are high, too. (But not me. I'm weird without any help.)</p>

      <p class="important">Warning: <span class="emphasized standout">We have no slow lorises here.</span></p>

      <h2 class="typewritter">This heading is in typewriter text.</h2>

      <p class="typewriter">This paragraph is also in typewriter text.</p>

      <p class="more-readable">Slow lorises are a group of several species of strepsirrhine primates which make up the genus
        Nycticebus. They have a round head, narrow snout, large eyes, and a variety of distinctive coloration
        patterns that are species-dependent.</p>

        <p class="spacey">It's great to be able to control spacing between letters, words and lines, but, unless you're a professional designer, it's a good idea not to try to be too creative with these options.</p>

        <p class="pretty">Slow lorises are a group of several species of strepsirrhine primates which make up the genus
          Nycticebus. They have a round head, narrow snout, large eyes, and a variety of distinctive coloration
          patterns that are species-dependent. Found in Southeast Asia and bordering areas, they range from Bangladesh and Northeast India in the west to the Phillipines in the east, and from Yunnan province in
          China in the north to the island of Java in the south.</p>

        <h3>Centered headings can look very nice.</h3>
        
        <p class="pretty">Justified text has always been used by professional designers. Before word processing came along, justification made text look professionally "typeset" since a typewriter couldn't do it. But now that almost any word processor can even out the right edge, justification doesn't have the prestige it used to enjoy. And, if a block of text is narrow, with few words per line, things can get pretty ugly, thanks to all those big gaps between words. These days, it's harder to justify justification.</p>
